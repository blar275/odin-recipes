        <h1>Lasagna</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. 
            It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, 
            made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. 
            After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in 
            layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it has 
            become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world. 
            Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with b√©chamel and meat sauce, is well known. 
            The Neapolitan version of this recipe includes among its ingredients tomato sauce, mozzarella, 
            meatballs and Roman ricotta cheese. In Liguria, pesto is used as a sauce, while in 
            Venice the sauce is replaced with red radicchio. The lasagna you eat depends on where you are.

            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
